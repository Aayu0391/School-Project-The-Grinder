						Hey! This is your friend from school. My birthday is coming up in 3 days. So i was planning to invite you, it would be a lot of fun! All of our friends are coming! We would have lots of fun together. We could even play outside for sometime! And we can even go and get ice-cream after! I hope you show up at my birthday in 3 days. I will be waiting for you.
